# String Indexing and Slicing

String indexing allows you to access individual characters in a string. You can do this by using square brackets and the location, or index, of the character you want to access. It's important to remember that Python starts indexes at 0. So to access the first character in a string, you would use the index [0]. If you try to access an index that’s larger than the length of your string, you’ll get an **IndexError**. This is because you’re trying to access something that doesn't exist! You can also access indexes from the end of the string going towards the start of the string by using negative values. The index [-1] would access the last character of the string, and the index [-2] would access the second-to-last character.

You can also access a portion of a string, called a slice or a substring. This allows you to access multiple characters of a string. You can do this by creating a range, using a colon as a separator between the start and end of the range, like [2:5]. This range is similar to the range() function we saw previously. It includes the first number, but goes to one less than the last number. You can also easily reference the start or end of the string by leaving one value blank. For example [:5] would give us all characters from the start to the fourth character in the string. We can also use [5:] to get the characters from the fourth character to the end of the string.
